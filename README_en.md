# Importing data from Yandex Object Storage, processing it, and exporting it into Yandex Managed Service for ClickHouse®

You can upload data into your [Object Storage](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/storage), process it with [Yandex Data Processing](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc), and then transfer it to a [Managed Service for ClickHouse®](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/managed-clickhouse) data mart, a one-stop solution for data visualization. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc/tutorials/s3-dataproc-ch) to learn how to set up the infrastructure for Object Storage, Yandex Data Processing, and Managed Service for ClickHouse® through Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [s3-dataproc-ch.tf](s3-dataproc-ch.tf).
